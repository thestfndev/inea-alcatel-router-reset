# inea-alcatel-router-reset

This is a script for automatic reboot of Alcatel I-241W-S.

This machine is one of the routers provided by INEA (a Polish ISP).

The config file has urls and auth information that INEA uses by default.

You can use as a one-time CLI helper, or add it to a cron file to have it automated.

Use it for good stuff, not evil.
